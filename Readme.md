# Fluffy-Waddle
## My First try at Coding in three years

Fuck it, I am making a blog....
Will think bout making something else after i get my brain working
I will Also add a Python script to help me post blogs daily
well daily aint possible due to the fact that i havent got internet at all times, and the mobile data is limited
it will only be possible if pushing to git takes less than 50 megs of data
i hate being so goddamn poor
gotta get my hands warmed up at this project before i could start on bigger projects...
i wish i could do this stuff withoud using any server sidea scripts or nodejs
after this i would probably be ready to learn nodejs
i am not sure about anything lol XD





Ok so i have made a bit of progress here.....
I have:
1. made a way to add file title to the homepage
1. add file name to antother file containing list of all the blog files
1. to find a way to deal with time and date 
1. been currently working on making new file and adding it as link with the title as text
1. to find a way to add git commit capability
1. to find how to use links in html lol im dumb done lol
1. so i have been able to add names and links of new files... but i cant find a way to create new html files done lol

Looks like i havebnt yet worked on styling and content of the blog
