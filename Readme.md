# Fluffy-Waddle
## My First try at Coding in three years

Fuck it, I am making a blog....
Will think bout making something else after i get my brain working
I will Also add a Python script to help me post blogs daily
well daily aint possible due to the fact that i havent got internet at all times, and the mobile data is limited
it will only be possible if pushing to git takes less than 50 megs of data
i hate being so goddamn poor
gotta get my hands warmed up at this project before i could start on bigger projects...
i wish i could do this stuff withoud using any server sidea scripts or nodejs
after this i would probably be ready to learn nodejs
i am not sure about anything lol XD





Ok so i have made a bit of progress here.....
I have:
1. made a way to add file title to the homepage
1. add file name to antother file containing list of all the blog files
1. to find a way to deal with time and date 
1. been currently working on making new file and adding it as link with the title as text
1. to find a way to add git commit capability
1. to find how to use links in html lol im dumb done lol
1. so i have been able to add names and links of new files... but i cant find a way to create new html files done lol

Looks like i havent yet worked on styling and content of the blog
bro usng insta from pc for ten minutes takes 500 megs, i hate my life..... i am so fucking broke goddamnit

### TODO:
1. Add time and date in the header of each blog
1. work on styling and content of blog
1. find ways to add multimedia
1. Add Styling manually to all the blogs created before the sidebar





### Styling
i just cant understand what kind of vibe i want it to be like..... there should be something i can hang on to as the main design idea , my personal portfolio website was in the purple-bluish space theme, TBH it looks good but i am not sure bout how much i like it for now


I have just found a wierd bug, the date-time part shows time but it also includes milliseconds........ i gotta fix it asap
